# Banking-Management-System-by-priya
Banking Management System is a console-based project developed in C language using Notepad. It allows users to create new accounts, deposit or withdraw money, view all accounts, and search by account number. The system uses file handling to store and manage customer data in a .txt file, and runs without any external libraries or tools.
